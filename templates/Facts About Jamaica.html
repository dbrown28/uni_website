        <h1>5 Random Facts About Jamaica</h1>
        <p>1- There are very few snakes that are wild in Jamaica. The mongoose was imported to Jamaica to get rid of the rats that would spil the cane fields in 1872. As an added benefit, the mongoose has killed off almost the entire population of snakes. So running
        across a snake is a rare occurrence in Jamaica.</p>
        <p>2 - The original aborigines of Jamaica were called the Arawaks, they grew corn and yams on jamaican soil. Today, the major crops of Jamaica are sugar cane, bananas, and mangoes. None of these crops are native to the island; they were imported to the island
        at varying times in the island’s history. Coconut Palms, breadfruit, and bamboo were also imported to the island.</p>
        <p>3 -African slaves imported to Jamaica brought their own form of religion, Obeahism. Obeahism is a form of voodoo that is still practiced on the island. However, it is kept secret since it is against the law and the penalty is death. People who practice
        this form of voodoo believe that the Obeah man can use evil spirits to bring good or bad luck to others.</p>
        <p>4 - In 1988, Jamaica became the first tropical country to enter a Winter Olympic event. It was the bobsled event. The movie, Cool Runnings, tells the story of the Jamaica’s first foray in to the Winter Olympics. Only the United States has won more Olympic
        and World medals than Jamaica.</p>
        <p>5 - The national dish of Jamaica is Ackee and Saltfish. Most people in Jamaica eat it as a breakfast dish. Ackee is a fruit that grows locally. The dish is served with dumplings that are either fried or boiled. The saltfish is cooked in a small amount
        of oil with peppers and onions added for taste.</p>
